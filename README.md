# Binary-Tree-Inorder-Traversal
This repository contains a Java implementation of the inorder traversal of a binary tree using both iterative and recursive methods. It includes a TreeNode class to represent the nodes of the tree and a Solution class that provides the traversal logic. The Main class demonstrates the functionality with various test cases.
